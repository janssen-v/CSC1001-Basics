How to Run the Programs
Note: All programs written and tested on Python 3.6.7 64-Bit on Ubuntu Linux 18.04
If there are any issues with regards to program execution beyond the scope of this
guide, please direct any and all questions to 119010518@link.cuhk.edu.cn

Question 1 - Interest Calculator
Follow the instructions shown and enter the values requested
The program will calculate the initial deposit amount required to reach
the input final account value at a given interest rate for the desired duration (years)

Question 2 - Display integer input in a vertical list
Follow the instructions on screen and input an integer. If a string or float is input,
the program will loop back to the beginning.

Question 3 - Finding the smallest n such that n^2 is greater than user input m
Follow the instructions on screen and input a number m. The program will output
the smallest integer n that has a square larger than input m.
Please note that the program does not accept string input and will crash in that case

Question 4 - Input number N and print a table with N rows and 3 columns
Follow the instructions on screen and input a number N. The program will generate
the table upon entering the value. The program does not accept any non-positive integer
input and will loop until a positive integer is input.

Question 5 - Input number N and find all prime numbers smaller than it
Note that the definition of prime numbers used in this program is any positive integer
that can not be divided into an integer with no remainder by any number other than 1
and itself. Thus, the program will not accept any input other than a positive integer.
Entering a string or a non positive integer will result in the program looping until
the user enters the correct input. Follow the instructions and enter the positive integer N,
and the program will output a list of primes smaller than the input number. The program will
output a maximum of 8 primes per line and will print the rest in a new line if there are more
than eight.

Question 6 - Integrator for sin cos and tan
Choose a trigonometric function to be integrated by typing the selected option.
There are three possible functions to be integrated: sin, cos, and tan.
Input must be in small caps only, and case sensitive. Any input that is not exactly
as specified by the onscreen prompt will be rejected and cause the program to loop.

After selecting the function to be integrated, choose the points at between which it will be integrated
upon, a and b, for example from 1 to 2. Then, input the sub-intervals at which the integration will be done,
the more sub-intervals, the more accurate the integration will be. Then the program will output the integrated value.
Do note that while the endpoints can be floating point numbers, the sub intervals must be an integer value.
Any illegal input will cause the program to loop back and repeat.
